# The Sparks Foundation: Data Science and Business Analytics Internship

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of my work as a Data Science and Business Analytics (DSBA) intern at **The Sparks Foundation**.

## TASK 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

In this task, we will be focusing on the `Decision Tree Algorithm`. The goal is to create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically so that if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Collection**: We will be using the `Iris` dataset available in the `scikit-learn` library.
2. **Decision Tree Model**: We will use the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn` to build the model.
3. **Visualization**: We will use `Matplotlib` to visualize the decision tree for better understanding.

Stay tuned for more updates!
